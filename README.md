# Firmware-bobip-V1
This is the firware of one of mi first project "The bobip" the bobip is a small pet that puts beautiful faces (similar to a emo robot). To run the code you need only an arduino nano connected to a small screen. 

With an I2C screen the connections are:

-VCC to 5V or 3.3V

-GND to GND

-SDA to A4

-SCL to A5

If you have a screen with SCK don't worry the connections are:

-VCC to 5V or 3.3V

-GND to GND

-SDA to A4

-SCK to A5

For the case I don't have the .gcode file yet because I haven't designed it yet
